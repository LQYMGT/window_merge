/**
 * @file dummy.c
 * Separates the details of the dummy conversation tab from the fray
 *
 * The dummy tab is a monstrosity bearing the original intention of simplifying
 * an area to which conversations could be dragged and attached.  It is only
 * supposed to be displayed when no conversations are open in a merged window.
 * Pidgin callbacks add and remove it as conversations come and go.

	   and the
	      third is the name of the conversation placement option.
	   3) The HTML formatting can be adjusted if it makes sense in a
	   particular
	      locale, but try to keep it consistent with the instructions tab
	      displayed in the Buddy List before the user defines any accounts.
